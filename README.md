Multi-day energy storage in GB's 2030 power grid

## Abstract
Long duration energy storage is seen as a key component towards decarbonising the power sector whilst maintaining energy security. Discussions in Great Britain (GB) are increasingly being held on ways to properly incentivise technologies that can store
energy cheaply for long durations. However, most solutions are not yet technologically or economically viable, and the literature as well as energy modelling on technologies
that can store energy for multiple days such as iron-air batteries is scarce. This paper shows that multi-day energy storage can reduce curtailment, emissions and provide
energy during long periods of system stress in GB’s 2030 electricity grid. It also finds that energy capital costs need to be at least lower than 26€/kWh to breakeven from
arbitrage, and that further revenue sources are most probably needed, even with capacity market payments. The results suggest that expanding variable renewables increases the
profitability of multi-day energy storage, and charging during negative prices could become a significant source of revenue. Although arbitrage profits can exceed
220,000€/MW in certain scenarios, the uncertainty with capital costs and annual revenues warrants policy-makers, regulators and investors to design policies and
markets for long duration energy storage to be profitable.
